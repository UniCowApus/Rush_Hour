# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

A rush hour model that can solve simple starting board arrangements. Try making your own model, and it should output the solution steps in your terminal!


## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
*`boardconfig.py`: Small class that's used to create board state objects. Comes with 3 example configurations in run.py, but you can add your own to solve custom puzzles.
